# Parallelization_Prac

 This project is simply a quick exercise in parallelizing different processes in order to speed up computation time. 
It is noted at with smaller computations parallelization benefits are negligible, however, as processes become more complex, it becomes important to calculate simultaneously rather than serially. 
  E.G. in the trapezoidal approximation problem compare the computation times when three trapezoids are used to approximate and then three thousand trapezoids. Computation times are generally lower than when serially performed. 

Check my Iris classification notebook for applications of parallelization on machine learning algorithms and how that affects speed.
